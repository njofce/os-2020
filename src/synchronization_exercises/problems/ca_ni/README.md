# Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>

You need to synchronize the process of creating the calcium nitride molecule. 3 Calcium an 2 Nitrogen
atoms are required to be present at the same time to form the molecule. All these items should call the method
`state.bond()`. After the molecule is former, only one should validate it by calling `state.validate()`. Use the starter
code to do the bond.
